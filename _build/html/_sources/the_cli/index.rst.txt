The CLI
=======

The falco CLI is included with the package installation. It provides a set of commands that I hope will be useful to you throughout the
lifecycle of your project, from project setup to deployment.

.. hint:: Install the cli
   :class: dropdown

   .. code:: console

      $ pip install falco


The entrypoint for the CLI is the ``falco`` command. It is used to run the commands that are available to you.
