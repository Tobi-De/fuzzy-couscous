Database backup
---------------

Whenever possible, take advantage of a fully managed database solution, they usually offer automatic backup of your databases.
In my opinion, this is the best option if you donâ€™t want to deal with the hassle of managing your own database.

-  `Amazon RDS <https://aws.amazon.com/rds/>`__
-  `Linode Managed Databases <https://www.linode.com/products/databases/>`__
-  `DigitalOcean Managed Databases <https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases>`__
-  `Heroku postgres <https://www.heroku.com/postgres>`__

For specific postgresql options, see their `hosting support page <https://www.postgresql.org/support/professional_hosting/>`__.

However, if for some reason you want / need to manage your database yourself and just want an automatic backup solution
then `django-dbbackup <https://github.com/jazzband/django-dbbackup>`__ is what you need. You can use one of the scheduling
packages discussed above to periodically run the backup command.
