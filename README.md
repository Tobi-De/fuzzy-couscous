A cli tool based on [django's startproject --template](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/django-admin/#startproject) to bootstrap
your django projects with a modern stack. The project template is heavily inspired by [cookiecutter-django](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter-django) but is meant to be a simpler version.
The cli also comes with [additional commands](https://tobi-de.github.io/fuzzy-couscous/usage/#cuzzy) to hopefully improve your django development experience.

## Templates

I use github branches to create variations of the base template.

- [main](https://github.com/Tobi-De/fuzzy-couscous): The base template
- [tailwind](https://github.com/Tobi-De/fuzzy-couscous/tree/tailwind): The base template + [tailwindcss](https://github.com/timonweb/pytailwindcss)  via [pytailwindcss](https://github.com/timonweb/pytailwindcss)
- [bootstrap](https://github.com/Tobi-De/fuzzy-couscous/tree/bootstrap): The base template + [bootstrap5](https://getbootstrap.com/) via [django-bootstrap5](https://github.com/zostera/django-bootstrap5)

> **Note**: If some of my decisions about the project template don't make sense to you, read [this section](https://tobi-de.github.io/fuzzy-couscous/project/) of the documentation.

## Quickstart

Install the latest version of the package

```shell
pip install fuzzy-couscous --upgrade
```

Initialize a new project

```shell
cuzzy make project_name
```

## Development

Poetry is required (not really, you can set up the environment however you want and install the requirements
manually) to set up a virtualenv, install it then run the following:

```sh
pre-commit install --install-hooks
```

Tests can then be run quickly in that environment:

```sh
pytest
```
