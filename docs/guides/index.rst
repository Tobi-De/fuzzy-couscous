Guides
======


Start with django documentation, this is just a compilation of common issues and solutions, most of the stuff here 
would speed more to people aleady a bit familiar with django.


External Ressources
~~~~~~~~~~

These are my personal picks of places to find best ressources on django and htmx

.. grid:: 2

    .. grid-item-card:: The official Django documentation
        :link: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/

        Always have a tab open to the official Django documentation. It is the best source of information.

    .. grid-item-card:: The HTMX documentation
        :link: https://htmx.org/

        Another tab you should always have open is the HTMX documentation.

    .. grid-item-card:: Adam Johnson blog
        :link: https://adamj.eu/tech/

        Learn the syntax of reStructuredText and examine how it is formatted.

    .. grid-item-card:: BugBytes youtube channels
        :link: https://www.youtube.com/bugbytes

        Your contributions can make a meaningful impact and help drive the project forward!
